# Django Online Store Fullstack Website
This is a website project I worked on as the sole worker for my final year/capstone project for my BSc (Hons) degree. I used the Django (v3.1.7) framework of the programming language Python (v3.8.8) and used Django's default built-in database SQLite (v3.34.0).
The project is a hypothetical website which I named “Techshelter Online Techstore” where user can visit to see technological items and gadgets, register as either customers or sellers to respectively buy or sell tech items and gadgets. Only A seller-type user has the privilege to see the functionalities which facilitate selling products and only a customer-type user can see and use the options which facilitate buying products. There also can be added managers and admins who has further privilleges to maintain the website and the business, which can be chosen only by an admin and only from among the registered users. Admins and managers have the privilege to see many options which other users do not have.
The website has a unique design with night themed lighting look, which I designed from my imagination and without using any front-end framework.
